npm start vs npm dev

npm start
    - When running the npm start command from the root directory of the project, node will look for a 'scripts' object in the package.json file.  Once found with the key 'start', it will run the command that is specified as its value.

npm dev
    - indicates that we're running the project in development mode and we're using 'nodemon' to do so.
    - nodemon allows us to make changes without having to restart the server after each change.

node_modules
    - packages that npm installs that allow our application and all of its dependencies to run properly.

package-lock.json
    - locks in the version of the packages that we're using.  
    - version control system that acts as a failsafe.

Express
    - lightweight web application framework used to help organize our application into a MVC architecture within our server.
        - MVC: Model View Controller
    - Not a model view controller framework by itself.  Still need to use our own ORM (object-relational mapping) library.
